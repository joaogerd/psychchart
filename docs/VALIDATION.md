# Scientific Validation of psychchart

## 1. Scope of validation

The `psychchart` package is intended for the generation of
psychrometric diagrams for scientific, educational and
research-oriented applications.

It is not intended to replace certified HVAC engineering
software, but to provide physically consistent diagrams
suitable for thermal comfort analysis and bioclimatic studies.

## 2. Psychrometric formulations

The psychrometric relationships implemented in `psychchart`
are based on classical formulations consistent with
ASHRAE Fundamentals.

- Saturation vapor pressure is computed using the
  Magnus–Tetens approximation.
- Humidity ratio, enthalpy and specific volume follow
  standard thermodynamic definitions.

These formulations provide adequate accuracy for
psychrometric chart construction.

## 3. Validation strategy

Validation was performed at three complementary levels:

### 3.1 Internal consistency checks

Automated tests verify that:
- saturation vapor pressure increases monotonically with temperature
- humidity ratio increases with relative humidity
- enthalpy increases with temperature and moisture content
- inverse relationships (W → RH) are internally consistent

### 3.2 Pointwise comparison with reference values

Selected reference points from the literature were used
to compare humidity ratio values.

An acceptable relative error threshold of 3% was adopted,
which is appropriate for diagrammatic psychrometric analysis.

### 3.3 Graphical validation

Psychrometric charts generated by `psychchart` were visually
compared against standard ASHRAE and Givoni diagrams.

The position and shape of the saturation curve, relative
humidity isolines and comfort zones were found to be
consistent with the literature.

## 4. Limitations

- The Magnus–Tetens approximation may introduce small
  deviations at extreme temperatures.
- No correction for elevation-dependent pressure is applied
  unless explicitly specified by the user.
- The package does not aim at high-precision HVAC design.

## 5. Conclusion

The validation results demonstrate that `psychchart`
produces physically consistent and scientifically valid
psychrometric diagrams within its intended scope of use.
