# Methods — Psychrometric Validation

The psychrometric relationships implemented in the `psychchart`
package are based on classical formulations consistent with
ASHRAE Fundamentals.

Saturation vapor pressure is computed using the
Magnus–Tetens approximation, which provides adequate accuracy
for psychrometric diagram construction.

Validation was performed through:
1. Internal consistency checks,
2. Pointwise comparison with reference values from the literature,
3. Graphical comparison against standard psychrometric charts.

An acceptable relative error threshold of 3% was adopted for
humidity ratio validation, which is appropriate for
diagrammatic psychrometric analysis and thermal comfort studies.
